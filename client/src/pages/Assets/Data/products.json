Drumatom 2 uses spectral processing to filter out the unwanted sounds, which preserves the original dynamics of the drummer's performance, such as ghost notes. After treating your tracks with Drumatom 2, you'll be able to compress and EQ them aggressively without fear of accentuating mic bleed. You'll also reduce your reliance on drum sample libraries, allowing you to maintain the unique sonic signature of the drummer's actual acoustic kit. Achieving a tight close-miked drum sound is a piece of cake with Drumatom 2.",

From its aggressive offset-V body shape to its scorching-hot active EMG humbucker, everything about this axe screams extreme metal. Nevertheless, it plays like butter, courtesy of a comfortable Thin U-shaped neck and fast-playing Macassar ebony fingerboard. This electric guitar comes armed with a single volume knob and a X kill switch — everything you need to conquer the underground with abrasive riffs and metallic screams.",

            "product_description": "Get an amazing compact keyboard controller and a polyphonic sequencer in one, with the Demo Comapny KeyStep. For starters, this compact controller keyboard includes a 32-note Arturia keybed, which is far more playable than typical under-sized keys. Keyboardists also appreciate the capacitive pitch and mod strips, which are easy to play but don't include moving parts that can get damaged in transit. But the coolest thing about the KeyStep is its advanced functions, such as Chord Play, which allows you to play a chord and then trigger it with single keys across the keyboard. Equally impressive is the onboard polyphonic 64-step sequencer, and when you combine that with its extensive CV, MIDI, DIN Sync, and Sync connectivity, the KeyStep is one of the most versatile compact keyboard controls around.",
