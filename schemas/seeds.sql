        "Accusonus Drumatom 2 improves the quality of your drum tracks by suppressing microphone leakage between channels. Use this innovative software to rescue badly recorded tracks, free up headroom, and simplify mixing. Drumatom 2 uses spectral processing to filter out the unwanted sounds, which preserves the original dynamics of the drummer's performance, such as ghost notes. After treating your tracks with Drumatom 2, you'll be able to compress and EQ them aggressively without fear of accentuating mic bleed. You'll also reduce your reliance on drum sample libraries, allowing you to maintain the unique sonic signature of the drummer's actual acoustic kit. Achieving a tight close-miked drum sound is a piece of cake with Drumatom 2.",
